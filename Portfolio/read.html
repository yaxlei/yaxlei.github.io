      <td>I've never heard of mail art until reading "Mail Art and the Big Monster" by Ulises Carrion, and honestly after reading this I'm still bit confused by what its purpose is, is this just for experimentation of mediums? Are we questioning the mail system? Are these only sent to other people who participate in mail art? Are the people who work at the post office meant to see it? Do they mail them to random people? Who is the audience? I think after asking myself all these questions, we are supposed to be thinking about how we communicate today, and how we overlook communication because we have technology so readily available to do so without struggling.</td>
      <td>This weeks reading, "Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully", positions websites in different perspectives the one would typically think of, a less rigid and incomplete version of what we think websites are. Describing different functions it could have as a shelf, a garden, a puddle, etc. to illustrate that websites can serve whatever purpose we need it to. The author also describes derailing from a linear way of intaking information. Urging readers to be intentional with the way they take in information by taking in information from different sources ( books, films, internet) at the same time instead of linearly one at a time.</td> 
      <td>In this week's reading an idea that was mentioned that I found really interesting was the "teleporting books" one. Where someone could print a book wherever and assemble it. It's an interesting idea that creates a middle to accessing books online and having a physical copy. I wonder if that idea would allow the book to look exactly like its physical version, with the cover and all vs. a bunch of printed pages put together. Besides that idea, I feel like it would be hard for print to not exist anymore, although ebooks are more accessible, many prefer the feel of a physical copy + are collectors and having those books all in a shelf is something they want vs. just having an online library. </td>

        <td>This weeks reading, STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives, by Olia Lialina is my favorite reading we've had so far. It was very interesting to read about how such an important piece of the web was just deleted and recovered. Before this class I had never heard of Geocities. I thought that mySpace was the first kind of space like that on the internet, but geocities clearly paved the way for websites like myspace and Facebook, which then in turn influenced our current social media. It's interesting to see how we've evolved from something like Geocities, that was unique and unstructured, to our more structured and sterile social media that all seem to follow the same formula.I wonder what our social media would be like today if it kept some of the more unique ideas from things like geocities. I also want to know what the process of recovering these geocities was like more in-depth.  </td>
        <td>This week's reading, Dispersion, by Seth Price was really confusing at first, the parts I understood the most was about what is considered art/not art? Public art, and distribution methods. Seeing how all of those different things connect and can make art more political/spread information makes me think of what we usually consider art, and if that modern art should also have a purpose like what we don't typically consider art? Personally I like the idea of art having a purpose, to be accessible, and spread awareness/information. I think we live in a time where seeing works that inform can be influential to the many issues we currently face in the world today. We also have a lot more access to different ways of making art + distribution methods that makes this more possible.</td> 
        <td>This weeks reading about Alt-Text opened up my perspective on how things should be described. When the author was first introducing alt-text as a poetic form I was a bit skeptical, wondering if that would just lose the actual description of the images, but as I read through my preconceived idea that images should be described as factually as possible changed. describing as factually as possible is actually the reason why some of the intent and meaning of the images get lost, by describing them in a poetic way you translate the intended image through words. </td>

        <td>The intro to this weeks reading was a bit confusing but necessary to the rest of reading because of the terms/ideas defined in the beginning. A big topic in this reading was Disney/Mickey mouse. Honestly surprised Mickey Mouse can be changed in so many ways to convey something else, it's not something I would've thought to do. Disney itself has been very influential to design and society, and even still today. I wonder when/how Disney will become obsolete or if it will continue to adapt to trends. This reading made me reflect on what kinds of graphic design trends I see now in the media I consume, and think about how it's evolved and influenced trends in other areas.</td>
        <td>I really enjoyed this weeks reading and the questions that it poses. I've always wondered how coding worked on the end of another language, very disappointed to find out that there's not accessibility for other languages. I feel like it defeats the purpose of giving children laptops if they can't even utilize them to the fullest. The big question at the end about making programming one big mesh of many languages was an interesting solution, because one language being replaced by another isn't a fix but I also wonder how we could make that work without any one language being dominant than the other in the mesh.</td> 
        <td>I had a hard time visualizing the description of the first piece of work. Seeing the video in class helped me out a bit, it's an interesting way to show/create art, it reminds me of the geocities reading. The body's missing piece was really interesting to me, I would like to look into that work more. </td>

        <td>In this weeks reading, Performing the Feed by Paul Soulellis, he explores the way we consume information on our feeds, the different ways it's presented and how those presentations can affect the information, the different possibilities, how that information can be used/manipulated, and the future possibilities of our feeds. This reading displays how our information is given to us is important and how these presentations keep evolving. As time goes on and we keep using new technology and navigating a world where we get our information from the internet, the way information is communicated and used will continue to morph alongside it.</td>
        <td>I enjoyed how this weeks reading was in the form of a story. It made it very easy to get lost in the text and follow with the concepts being discussed in the reading.  The reading drew from real world events to illustrate how the things we experience in real life can also be experienced in computers and software. For example when Gem was in the train in The Way, things were explained from only one perspective of that history that didn't tell the whole story and claimed to be the only way, while in the Beyond you saw a community of perspectives and people who experienced and felt the same. The author shows us that software is made by and for the people in power and using it can be made harder for people who do not fit that box, but by designing better practices and relying on other designers we can make it more accessible. </td> 
        <td>This week's reading was somewhat easy to follow through in the beginning with the ideas of how video games can disassociate people from their actions/the reality of war and other harmful actions. Further in I started to get a bit lost, one part of this reading I found really interesting and have heard about in a prior class is the social credit score in China, which predicts how well you will do based on the things that you do for example, if you play 10 hours of video games you won't be as successful. The social credit score feels like something you'd find out of one of those dystopian books, and I think we hear of governments doing things like that and are so unphased by it because of everything we are exposed to, when instead we should be alarmed because we will end up like the books that we read where we think it's crazy and so far off, but it isn't actually that far off.</td>
